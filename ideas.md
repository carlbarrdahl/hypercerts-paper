# Notes on hypercerts v.2 architecture

- erc4626 vault for projects
  - shares can be minted to stewards, project owners, contributors
  - early funders can buy shares by calling deposit
  - grants and other funding can fund vault without minting shares
  - this mechanism increases the value of the shares
  - the vault contains a string for metadata (ipfs hash) where details about the project is stored
- eas attestations can be created to the project vault:
  - data stored in IPFS (storacha?)
  - work claims: self-reported impact work that has been done
  - verifications / evaluations: organizations measure and evalutate said work claims
  - resources can be attached to work claims and/or verifications: endorsements / reviews can point to any of the other attestation types above
- off-chain attestations are created as drafts and can be published to on-chain
  - stored in a hypercerts postgres db
  - this is also where private attestations are kept
- this creates a bundle or a network graph of attestations and impact created and evaluated with supporting evidence.
- smart accounts for accounts (hyper account is canonical and can work across platforms and organization multisig with zodiac module for roles as well as metadata)
- 1 evm network is chosen as the canonical
- ponder indexer indexers all data (organization smart account metadata, attestations, vaults, etc): it also handles multi chain
- the indexer creates embeddings and minhash/simhash to discover potential double claims as well as provinging powerful search. it also handles geojson for powerful spatial queries
