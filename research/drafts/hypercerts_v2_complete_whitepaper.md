# Abstract

Public goods funding faces a fundamental attribution problem: how to fairly reward contributors for impact that is non-excludable, non-rivalrous, and often emerges through complex collaboration networks. Existing mechanisms—from grants to retroactive funding programs—struggle to scale attribution across large ecosystems while maintaining transparency and preventing gaming.

We present Hypercerts v.2, a comprehensive framework that combines tokenized project vaults, decentralized attestation systems, and automated impact evaluation to enable scalable retrospective funding. Our architecture integrates three key innovations: (1) ERC4626 vaults that align early funders with long-term project success through shared upside mechanisms, (2) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain attestation system using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) with Ponder indexing for unified data management, and (3) a configurable hybrid PageRank algorithm that attributes impact across networks of agents, artifacts, and outcomes.

The system models contributions as a directed weighted graph where agents (contributors) create artifacts (code, papers, designs) that generate outcomes (funding, citations, usage). Our hybrid attribution algorithm combines forward influence propagation with reverse credit flow, balanced by community-configurable parameters that encode domain-specific value systems. This enables automated reward distribution while preserving human judgment in weight setting and evaluation quality.

We demonstrate the framework's applicability across diverse domains including scientific research, environmental projects, open-source software, and creative industries. The architecture supports both public transparency through on-chain attestations and privacy through off-chain storage, with semantic similarity detection to prevent duplicate claims and gaming.

Hypercerts v.2 provides a scalable, interoperable foundation for impact funding that could transform how we coordinate and incentivize work on public and common goods. By automating attribution while preserving community governance, the system enables retrospective funding at unprecedented scale while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to domain-specific needs and evolving value systems.

# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Public Goods Funding Problem

Public goods—from scientific research and open-source software to environmental conservation and artistic works—suffer from chronic underfunding due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. Contributors cannot easily capture the value they create, leading to market failures where socially beneficial work remains under-incentivized. Traditional funding mechanisms attempt to address this through grants, donations, and philanthropic support, but these approaches face fundamental limitations.

**Attribution Complexity**: Most impactful work emerges from complex networks of collaboration, building on prior contributions, and involving both visible and hidden contributors. A breakthrough scientific paper may depend on dozens of prior works, infrastructure maintained by volunteers, and peer reviewers who remain anonymous. Current funding systems struggle to fairly attribute and reward all participants in these contribution networks.

**Scaling Challenges**: Expert-driven evaluation, while high-quality, cannot scale to evaluate the thousands of projects and millions of contributors in modern digital ecosystems. Manual review processes create bottlenecks and introduce subjective biases that may systematically under-reward certain types of contributions or contributors.

**Temporal Misalignment**: The value of public goods often becomes apparent only after significant time delays. A mathematical proof may take decades to find practical applications; an environmental conservation project may show benefits only over generational timescales. Traditional funding requires predictions about future impact, but these predictions are notoriously unreliable.

**Gaming and Verification**: Any funding system creates incentives for strategic behavior. Contributors may inflate their contributions, duplicate claims across platforms, or engage in collusive evaluation. Verifying the authenticity and uniqueness of impact claims becomes increasingly difficult as systems scale.

## 1.2 Vision: Hypercerts v.2

Hypercerts v.2 addresses these challenges through a comprehensive framework that separates funding, attestation, evaluation, and reward distribution into modular, interoperable components. The system builds on the foundational concept of hypercerts—semi-fungible tokens that encode claims about work and impact—while introducing novel mechanisms for automated attribution and retrospective reward distribution.

**Key Innovations**:

1. **Tokenized Project Vaults**: ERC4626-compliant vaults represent projects as tokenized entities where shares can be minted to different stakeholder classes (contributors, early funders, stewards). This creates aligned incentives where early risk-taking is rewarded through upside participation in future funding rounds.

2. **Hybrid Attestation System**: Combines the transparency of on-chain Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) records with the privacy and flexibility of off-chain storage. Contributors can create private draft attestations, collaborate on verification, and selectively publish to the public chain.

3. **Automated Impact Attribution**: A configurable hybrid PageRank algorithm analyzes networks of contributions to automatically distribute attribution scores. The algorithm combines forward influence propagation (rewarding structural importance) with reverse credit flow (emphasizing proximity to valued outcomes).

4. **Multi-chain Integration**: Ponder-based indexing aggregates data across multiple blockchains while creating semantic embeddings for duplicate detection and spatial queries for location-based impact verification.

![Vault Architecture](../../resources/vault.png)
_Figure 2: ERC4626 vault structure showing multi-stakeholder share classes and value accrual mechanisms_

**Alignment with Retrospective Funding**: Unlike traditional grants that fund promises, Hypercerts v.2 emphasizes retrospective funding—rewarding work after its impact has been demonstrated. However, the tokenized vault structure ensures that early supporters can still participate in upside, addressing the capital formation challenges that pure retrospective systems face.

## 1.3 Theoretical Foundation

The system implements the Generalized Impact Evaluators (GIE) framework, which formalizes impact funding as a tuple IE = {r, e, m, S} where:

- **Scope (S)** defines the entities and relationships under consideration
- **Measurement (m)** collects data about contributions and outcomes
- **Evaluation (e)** computes relative importance scores
- **Reward (r)** distributes resources proportionally

By making these components explicit and modular, Hypercerts v.2 enables different stakeholders to specialize: data providers focus on measurement quality, algorithm designers optimize evaluation methods, and funding organizations manage reward distribution. This separation of concerns allows the system to evolve and adapt while maintaining interoperability.

## 1.4 Paper Contributions

This paper makes several key contributions:

**Technical Architecture**: We present the complete technical specification for Hypercerts v.2, including smart contract interfaces, data schemas, and integration protocols. This provides a concrete implementation path for the theoretical GIE framework.

**Hybrid Attribution Algorithm**: We develop a novel hybrid PageRank algorithm that combines structural network analysis with outcome-based attribution, enabling communities to configure evaluation parameters to reflect their specific value systems.

**Privacy-Preserving Attestation**: We design a graduated transparency system where sensitive work claims can be developed privately before selective public disclosure, addressing real-world needs for confidentiality in competitive research and commercial applications.

**Empirical Applications**: We analyze concrete use cases across scientific research, environmental projects, open-source software, and creative industries, demonstrating the framework's broad applicability while identifying domain-specific adaptation requirements.

**Implementation Framework**: We provide detailed implementation considerations including gaming resistance mechanisms, privacy trade-offs, governance structures, and adoption strategies necessary for real-world deployment.

The result is a comprehensive system that could transform how we fund and coordinate work on public goods, enabling retrospective funding at unprecedented scale while preserving the human judgment and community governance necessary for legitimacy and adaptation.

## 2.1 Impact Funding Mechanisms

### 2.1.1 Quadratic Funding and Liberal Radicalism

Quadratic funding, introduced by Buterin, Hitzig, and Weyl (2018), addresses the public goods funding problem by using matching funds to amplify small donations while limiting the influence of large donors. The mechanism allocates matching funds proportional to the square of the sum of square roots of individual contributions, theoretically optimizing for community preference while mitigating plutocratic influence.

Gitcoin has implemented quadratic funding at scale, distributing millions of dollars to open-source projects and demonstrating both the potential and limitations of the approach. Key challenges include Sybil resistance (preventing fake identities from gaming the matching algorithm), collusion detection, and the need for trusted matching fund sources. While effective for distributing existing pools of capital, quadratic funding does not directly address the attribution problem—determining which specific contributors deserve rewards for observed impact.

### 2.1.2 Retroactive Public Goods Funding (RetroPGF)

The Optimism Collective pioneered Retroactive Public Goods Funding, distributing over $30 million across multiple rounds based on demonstrated impact rather than future promises. RetroPGF programs use expert voting panels to evaluate projects after impact has been observed, addressing the temporal misalignment problem inherent in prospective funding.

However, recent research by Yu et al. (2025) identifies significant vulnerabilities in voting-based RetroPGF systems, including strategic manipulation, voting coordination attacks, and the difficulty of scaling expert evaluation. Their analysis of Optimism's RetroPGF rounds reveals that voting mechanisms can be gamed through strategic project timing, voter coordination, and the exploitation of information asymmetries between evaluators and project participants.

These findings highlight the need for automated evaluation mechanisms that can scale while preserving the core insight of retrospective funding—that impact should be rewarded after it is demonstrated rather than before it is promised.

### 2.1.3 Generalized Impact Evaluators Framework

Network Goods (2023) formalized the concept of Generalized Impact Evaluators (GIE) as modular systems for coordinating work through measurement, evaluation, and reward distribution. The GIE framework defines impact evaluators as tuples IE = {r, e, m, S} where each component can be independently optimized and composed with other system components.

This modularity enables specialization: measurement systems can focus on data quality and coverage, evaluation algorithms can optimize for fairness and accuracy, and reward mechanisms can adapt to different economic models and stakeholder preferences. The framework provides the theoretical foundation for Hypercerts v.2's architectural separation of concerns.

However, the GIE framework primarily addresses the theoretical structure of impact evaluation without providing concrete implementations or addressing practical challenges like gaming resistance, privacy preservation, and adoption incentives. Our work contributes a complete implementation of the GIE framework with specific solutions for these practical challenges.

## 2.2 Attribution and Evaluation Systems

### 2.2.1 Citation Networks and Academic Attribution

Academic citation networks provide one of the most mature examples of large-scale attribution systems. Citation analysis algorithms, from simple citation counts to sophisticated measures like the h-index and PageRank-based eigenfactor scores, attempt to quantify research impact by analyzing networks of scholarly references.

However, academic attribution faces well-documented challenges: citation practices vary across disciplines, self-citation and citation cartels can game metrics, and important contributions like peer review, data collection, and infrastructure maintenance remain invisible in citation networks. These challenges parallel those faced by any large-scale attribution system and inform the design of Hypercerts v.2's gaming resistance mechanisms.

The success of citation-based systems despite these limitations demonstrates that network-based attribution can function at scale when supported by appropriate social norms and institutional structures. Academic institutions have developed practices around citation ethics, peer review processes, and reputation systems that could inform governance mechanisms for decentralized attribution systems.

### 2.2.2 PageRank and Network Centrality

PageRank, developed by Page, Brin, Motwani, and Winograd (1999) for web search, computes node importance in directed graphs by recursively defining a node's importance as proportional to the importance of nodes that link to it. The algorithm's success in web search demonstrates the power of network-based importance measures for large-scale evaluation.

Extensions of PageRank include personalized PageRank (which biases random walks toward specific starting nodes), topic-sensitive PageRank (which adapts importance scores to query contexts), and various centrality measures like eigenvector centrality and HITS (Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search). These extensions provide theoretical foundations for adapting PageRank to the specific requirements of impact attribution.

Our hybrid PageRank algorithm extends this work by combining forward influence propagation with reverse credit attribution, enabling the same graph structure to support both "effort-based" evaluation (rewarding structural importance) and "outcome-based" evaluation (emphasizing proximity to demonstrated value). The configurable balance between these modes allows communities to encode their specific value systems into the attribution algorithm.

### 2.2.3 Decentralized Attestation Systems

The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) provides infrastructure for creating and verifying arbitrary attestations on-chain. EAS enables anyone to create attestation schemas, make attestations against those schemas, and compose attestations into complex verification workflows. This provides the foundational infrastructure for verifiable impact claims.

However, pure on-chain attestation faces challenges around privacy (all attestations are public), cost (gas fees for each attestation), and flexibility (difficulty updating or retracting attestations). Off-chain attestation systems address these challenges but sacrifice verifiability and composability. Our hybrid approach combines the benefits of both systems through EAS's unified on-chain/off-chain attestation model.

Similar hybrid approaches appear in other decentralized systems: Git combines local repositories with distributed synchronization, and blockchain systems often use off-chain scaling solutions with periodic on-chain settlement. The pattern of local flexibility with global verifiability appears broadly applicable to decentralized coordination systems.

![Data Models](../../resources/data_models.png)
_Figure 3: Core data models showing relationships between agents, artifacts, outcomes, and attestations_

## 3.1 Architectural Overview

Hypercerts v.2 implements a three-layer architecture that separates data persistence, business logic, and user interfaces while enabling interoperability across blockchain networks and storage systems. This design allows different components to evolve independently while maintaining system coherence and enabling specialized optimization of each layer.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The architecture implements the Generalized Impact Evaluator framework by distributing its functions across these layers: measurement occurs primarily in the data layer, evaluation in the logic layer, and reward distribution through the combination of logic and interface layers. The scope function spans all layers through filtering and access control mechanisms.

## 3.2 Data Layer Architecture

### 3.2.1 Unified Data Architecture

**Ponder Indexer as Central Database**: Ponder serves as the primary data layer, indexing and normalizing data from multiple sources into a unified PostgreSQL database. This eliminates architectural complexity by having a single source of truth while maintaining data sovereignty across different systems.

**EAS Integration**: Both on-chain and off-chain EAS attestations are indexed by Ponder, which normalizes their different formats into consistent database schemas. This creates a unified view of:

- On-chain attestations (permanent, transparent, higher gas cost)
- Off-chain attestations (flexible, private, lower cost)
- Cross-chain attestations from multiple networks

**IPFS with Storacha**: Provides decentralized storage for attestation metadata, project documentation, and supporting evidence. The content-addressable nature of IPFS ensures data integrity while Storacha's incentive layer provides persistence guarantees. Project vaults include IPFS hash metadata fields that point to detailed project descriptions, contribution guidelines, and evaluation criteria.

### 3.2.2 Simplified Data Flow

**Unified Indexing**: Ponder eliminates architectural complexity by serving as the single data normalization layer:

1. **Data Creation**: Attestations created via EAS (on-chain or off-chain), funding events into ERC4626 vaults
2. **Data Indexing**: Ponder monitors and indexes all EAS attestations plus blockchain events across multiple networks
3. **Data Normalization**: Ponder transforms diverse attestation schemas and transaction data into unified graph structures
4. **Graph Construction**: Attribution algorithms operate directly on the normalized Ponder database

**Cross-chain Identity**: Smart accounts serve as canonical identity anchors that can operate across multiple blockchain networks. Using account abstraction standards, contributors maintain consistent identities regardless of which network they interact with, enabling attribution that spans chain boundaries.

**Spatial Data Support**: The indexer includes PostGIS extensions for handling geospatial data, enabling location-based impact verification for environmental and social projects. GeoJSON data attached to attestations can support queries like "all forest restoration projects within 100km of this location" or "carbon offset projects in tropical regions."

### 3.2.3 Semantic Search and Duplicate Detection

**Embedding Generation**: The system generates vector embeddings for attestation text using transformer-based language models. These embeddings enable semantic similarity search and help identify potentially duplicate or related claims across different projects and contributors.

**MinHash and SimHash**: Implements locality-sensitive hashing algorithms to efficiently detect near-duplicate content at scale. MinHash identifies similar sets of contributors or project dependencies, while SimHash detects similar textual descriptions or claims.

**Duplicate Resolution Workflows**: When potential duplicates are detected, the system creates flagged review queues where human evaluators can determine whether claims represent legitimate overlapping work, complementary contributions, or actual gaming attempts. This hybrid automated-human approach balances scale with accuracy.

## 3.3 Logic Layer Architecture

### 3.3.1 ERC4626 Vault System

**Tokenized Project Representation**: Each project is represented as an ERC4626 vault that holds assets and manages shares representing different forms of ownership and participation. This standard interface enables composability with existing DeFi infrastructure while providing project-specific customization.

![Nested Vaults](../../resources/nested_vaults.png)
_Figure 4: Nested vault architecture showing how projects can be composed hierarchically with cross-vault attribution_

**Multi-class Share Structure**: Vaults support different share classes with distinct rights and characteristics:

- **Contributor shares**: Minted to contributors based on verified work claims
- **Steward shares**: Allocated to project maintainers and governance participants
- **Founder shares**: Reserved for project initiators with potential vesting schedules
- **Investor shares**: Purchased by early funders through deposit mechanisms

**Value Accrual Mechanisms**: Vault value increases through multiple channels:

- Grant funding deposited without minting new shares (pure value increase)
- Fee capture from project usage or derivative works
- Retrospective funding allocated based on demonstrated impact
- Secondary market appreciation of vault shares

### 3.3.2 Smart Account Integration

**Canonical Identity System**: Each participant maintains a smart account that serves as their canonical identity across the system. These accounts integrate with existing identity providers while maintaining sovereignty and portability.

**Multi-signature and Role-based Access**: Organizations can deploy multi-signature smart accounts with role-based permissions using Zodiac modules. This enables complex governance structures while maintaining security and accountability. The smart contract also includes a Metadata module that contains information about the organizations (this is picked up by the Ponder indexer).

**Cross-platform Compatibility**: Smart accounts implement account abstraction standards that enable operation across different blockchain networks and integration with traditional systems through API bridges.

### 3.3.3 Attestation Processing Engine

**Schema Validation**: Enforces standardized schemas for different types of attestations while enabling community-specific extensions. Core schemas include work claims, verifications, endorsements, and resource allocations.

**Workflow Management**: Implements state machines for attestation lifecycles, including draft creation, collaborative editing, verification processes, and publication workflows. Different attestation types can follow different approval processes based on their schemas and risk profiles.

**Privacy Controls**: Manages access permissions for different attestation visibility levels:

- **Private**: Visible only to attestation creator and explicitly authorized parties
- **Organizational**: Visible within specific organizations or project boundaries
- **Public Draft**: Visible to community for review and comment before publication
- **Published**: Permanently published to EAS with full transparency

## 3.4 Attribution and Evaluation Architecture

### 3.4.1 EAS-Based Graph Construction

**Attestation-Driven Node Creation**: The system extracts graph nodes directly from EAS attestations indexed by Ponder:

- **Agents**: Contributors, evaluators, and organizations referenced in attestations
- **Artifacts**: Projects, repositories, papers, and works claimed or evaluated
- **Outcomes**: Funding events, grants, citations, and impact measurements

**Graph Edges from Attestation Types**: Relationships are derived from standardized EAS attestation schemas:

- **Work Claims**: Create Agent → Artifact edges (contribution relationships)
- **Evaluations**: Generate Outcome → Artifact edges (impact valuation)
- **Endorsements**: Form Agent → Agent edges (trust and reputation)
- **Funding Events**: Produce Outcome → Vault edges (financial flows)
- **Dependencies**: Link Artifact → Artifact edges (building upon prior work)

![Trust Graph](../../resources/trust_graph.png)
_Figure 5: Trust and reputation graph showing how endorsement attestations create networks of credibility_

**Weight Calculation**: Edge weights combine multiple factors:

- Attestation confidence scores provided by creators
- Community verification status and reputation
- Temporal decay functions for aging contributions
- Domain-specific multipliers for different edge types

### 3.4.2 Hybrid PageRank Implementation

**Forward Pass**: Computes structural importance by running standard PageRank on the contribution graph. This rewards agents and artifacts that are well-connected and serve as hubs in the contribution network, regardless of outcome realization.

**Reverse Pass**: Reverses edges from outcome nodes and runs personalized PageRank with outcomes as personalization seeds. This propagates credit backward from demonstrated value to the agents and artifacts that contributed to that value.

**Hybrid Combination**: Final scores combine forward and reverse rankings using a configurable balance parameter α:

```
Score(agent) = α × Forward_Score(agent) + (1-α) × Reverse_Score(agent)
```

**Configuration Management**: Communities can adjust evaluation parameters through governance mechanisms:

- Balance parameter α (structural vs. outcome emphasis)
- Edge type multipliers (relative importance of different contribution types)
- Temporal decay rates (how quickly old contributions lose weight)
- Personalization vectors (which outcomes to emphasize)

### 3.4.3 Reward Distribution System

**Score Normalization**: Attribution scores are normalized to sum to 1.0 within each evaluation scope, enabling proportional distribution of fixed reward pools.

**Multi-pool Support**: The system can simultaneously manage multiple reward pools with different distribution criteria:

- Project-specific pools funded by project revenues
- Cross-project pools for infrastructure contributions
- Time-bounded pools for specific funding rounds
- Stakeholder-specific pools (e.g., only for certain contributor classes)

**Continuous vs. Batch Distribution**: Supports both continuous reward distribution (as new funding arrives) and batch distribution (periodic reward rounds with accumulated funds).

**Counterfactual Analysis**: Provides tools for analyzing how reward distributions would change under different parameter settings or data scenarios, enabling communities to understand the effects of their governance decisions.

# 4. Funding Mechanics

## 4.1 Vault-Based Project Funding Model

### 4.1.1 ERC4626 Vault Structure

Hypercerts v.2 represents each project as an ERC4626-compliant vault that serves as both a funding vehicle and a coordination mechanism. Unlike traditional project funding where capital flows directly to project accounts, the vault structure creates a persistent entity that can accumulate value over time while maintaining transparent governance and accountability.

**Asset Management**: Vaults hold multiple asset types including stablecoins, ETH, governance tokens, and other digital assets. The standardized ERC4626 interface ensures compatibility with existing DeFi infrastructure while enabling project-specific customization of deposit and withdrawal mechanics.

**Share Token Economics**: Vault shares represent proportional ownership in the project's accumulated value and future cash flows. The total value of shares increases through multiple mechanisms:

- Grant deposits that add assets without minting new shares
- Revenue generation from project usage or licensing
- Retrospective funding based on demonstrated impact
- Appreciation of held assets and governance tokens

**Metadata Integration**: Each vault includes IPFS metadata hashes that point to comprehensive project documentation including contribution guidelines, evaluation criteria, governance structures, and impact measurement frameworks. This creates a verifiable link between the financial instrument (vault shares) and the project's actual work and impact.

### 4.1.2 Multi-Stakeholder Share Classes

The vault system supports differentiated share classes that align different stakeholder incentives while maintaining overall project coherence:

**Contributor Shares**: Minted to individuals and organizations based on verified work contributions. These shares carry both economic rights (proportional reward distribution) and governance rights (voting on project direction). Contributor shares can be:

- **Performance-based**: Minted based on measured outputs (code commits, papers published, experiments completed)
- **Impact-based**: Allocated through the attribution algorithm based on downstream value creation
- **Time-based**: Earned through sustained participation and stewardship activities

**Early Funder Shares**: Purchased by investors and supporters through the vault's deposit mechanism. Early funders provide essential capital for project initiation and operation while receiving potential upside through share appreciation. Key features include:

- **Risk-adjusted pricing**: Share prices may reflect project risk and development stage
- **Vesting schedules**: Shares may vest over time to encourage long-term alignment
- **Liquidity mechanisms**: Secondary markets enable early funders to exit while preserving project continuity

**Steward Shares**: Allocated to project maintainers, governance participants, and community builders who provide ongoing coordination and maintenance. Stewardship activities include:

- Technical maintenance and security updates
- Community building and contributor onboarding
- Governance participation and dispute resolution
- External relationship management and partnership development

**Founder Shares**: Reserved for project initiators with potential vesting schedules that align founder incentives with long-term project success. Founder allocation policies vary by project but typically include:

- Initial allocation based on pre-launch contributions
- Ongoing allocation based on leadership and vision
- Vesting terms that encourage sustained commitment
- Dilution protection mechanisms for major value creation events

### 4.1.3 Value Accrual and Distribution

**Grant Integration**: Traditional grants can fund vault operations without diluting existing shareholders by depositing assets directly into the vault. This increases the net asset value per share while preserving the proportional ownership structure. Grant providers may:

- Specify how funds should be allocated across different project activities
- Require reporting on fund usage and impact achievement
- Establish milestone-based disbursement schedules
- Retain governance rights proportional to their funding contribution

**Revenue Capture**: Projects that generate revenue through licensing, services, or product sales can direct these funds to the vault, benefiting all stakeholders proportionally. Revenue streams may include:

- Software licensing and support contracts
- Research data and analysis services
- Educational content and training programs
- Consulting and implementation services

**Retrospective Funding Integration**: When external retrospective funding programs (like Optimism RetroPGF or private foundation grants) reward projects, these funds flow to vaults and increase share value. The automated attribution system can provide evidence for funding applications and distribute awards appropriately among contributors.

## 4.2 Stakeholder Incentive Alignment

### 4.2.1 Early Funder Reward Mechanisms

Early funders face significant risk when supporting projects with uncertain outcomes. The vault structure addresses this through several mechanisms that provide upside participation while protecting against total loss:

**Shared Upside**: When projects receive grants, achieve adoption milestones, or generate revenue, early funders benefit through share appreciation rather than just receiving reports on fund usage. This creates incentive alignment between funders and projects.

**Risk Diversification**: Funders can purchase shares in multiple project vaults, creating portfolio effects that reduce overall risk while maintaining exposure to high-potential projects.

**Secondary Markets**: Share transferability enables early funders to exit positions as projects mature and risk profiles change, providing liquidity that traditional grant funding lacks.

**Governance Participation**: Early funders receive voting rights proportional to their share ownership, enabling them to influence project direction and protect their investments through active governance participation.

### 4.2.2 Contributor Incentive Structures

Contributors need assurance that their efforts will be fairly recognized and rewarded, particularly for high-risk, high-impact work that may not show immediate results:

**Immediate Recognition**: Contributor shares are minted based on verified work claims, providing immediate tokenization of contributions even before impact is fully realized.

**Long-term Upside**: As projects succeed and attract funding, contributor shares appreciate in value, ensuring that contributors benefit from the long-term success of their work.

**Cross-project Attribution**: The global attribution system enables contributors to receive recognition and rewards for infrastructure work that benefits multiple projects, addressing the underinvestment problem in shared resources.

**Reputation Building**: Verified contributions and successful project outcomes build contributor reputation scores that influence future share allocations and funding opportunities.

### 4.2.3 Grant Provider Value Proposition

Traditional grant providers (foundations, governments, DAOs) gain several advantages from integrating with the vault system:

**Increased Impact Leverage**: Grant funds that increase vault value benefit all stakeholders, creating multiplicative effects where grant funds attract additional investment and contributor effort.

**Transparent Impact Tracking**: The integrated attribution and evaluation system provides grant providers with detailed evidence of fund usage and impact achievement, addressing accountability requirements.

**Reduced Due Diligence Costs**: Standardized project vaults with consistent reporting and evaluation mechanisms reduce the cost and complexity of grant evaluation and monitoring.

**Portfolio Management**: Grant providers can maintain ongoing relationships with funded projects through share ownership rather than terminating involvement after grant disbursement.

# 5. Impact Evaluation Method

## 5.1 Graph-Based Attribution Model

### 5.1.1 Heterogeneous Graph Representation

The impact evaluation system models contribution networks as directed, weighted, heterogeneous graphs G = (V, E) where nodes represent different types of entities and edges encode various relationships between them. This graph-theoretic approach enables systematic analysis of complex contribution patterns that span multiple projects, organizations, and domains.

**Node Types and Classification**:

- **Agents (A)**: Individual contributors, organizations, institutions, and other actors who perform work or make decisions. Examples include researchers, developers, project maintainers, funding organizations, and evaluation bodies.
- **Artifacts (B)**: Tangible outputs and intermediate products created through work. Examples include code repositories, research papers, datasets, designs, protocols, and documentation.
- **Outcomes (C)**: Observable value signals that indicate impact realization. Examples include grant awards, citations, downloads, adoption metrics, revenue generation, and social impact measurements.

**Edge Types and Semantics**:

- **Creation edges (A → B)**: Link agents to artifacts they created, with weights reflecting effort contribution, leadership roles, or authorship shares.
- **Contribution edges (A → C)**: Connect agents to outcomes they helped achieve, including both direct attribution and collaborative contributions.
- **Dependency edges (B → B)**: Relate artifacts that build upon, cite, or incorporate other artifacts, enabling transitive attribution through dependency chains.
- **Valuation edges (C → B)**: Connect outcomes to the artifacts they recognize or reward, such as grants funding specific projects or citations acknowledging particular works.
- **Attribution edges (C → A)**: Direct connections from outcomes to agents, representing explicit recognition or reward allocation.

### 5.1.2 Weight Calculation and Confidence Scoring

**Multi-factor Weight Computation**: Edge weights combine several factors to reflect the strength and reliability of relationships:

```
Weight(e) = Base_Weight(e) × Confidence(e) × Type_Multiplier(e) × Temporal_Decay(e)
```

- **Base Weight**: The fundamental strength of the relationship, derived from attestations, transaction amounts, citation counts, or other quantitative measures.
- **Confidence Score**: Community assessment of relationship reliability, incorporating verification status, reviewer reputation, and evidence quality.
- **Type Multiplier**: Community-configured parameters that adjust the relative importance of different edge types based on domain-specific value systems.
- **Temporal Decay**: Time-based discounting that prevents old contributions from dominating current evaluations while preserving historical attribution.

**Confidence Scoring Framework**: The system implements a multi-layered confidence assessment:

- **Self-reported confidence**: Creators provide initial confidence estimates based on their certainty about the relationship
- **Peer verification**: Community members can verify or dispute claims, with verification weighted by reviewer reputation
- **Automated consistency checks**: Algorithms identify potential inconsistencies or anomalies that may indicate errors or gaming attempts
- **Cross-reference validation**: Claims are checked against external data sources where available (blockchain transactions, public repositories, citation databases)

### 5.1.3 Dynamic Graph Construction

**Incremental Updates**: The graph structure updates continuously as new attestations are created, existing claims are verified, and temporal decay functions reduce the weight of aging relationships. This enables real-time attribution that responds to evolving contribution patterns.

**Scope Management**: Different evaluation contexts require different graph scopes. The system supports:

- **Project-specific graphs**: Focus on contributions within individual projects
- **Domain-specific graphs**: Include related projects within specific fields (e.g., climate research, open-source security tools)
- **Cross-domain graphs**: Capture interdisciplinary contributions and infrastructure work that spans multiple domains
- **Temporal scoping**: Limit analysis to specific time periods or include historical contributions with appropriate decay

**Missing Node Handling**: The graph model gracefully handles incomplete information by creating placeholder nodes for entities that are referenced but not fully characterized. This enables attribution to flow through unknown intermediaries while identifying areas where additional data collection might improve accuracy.

## 5.2 Hybrid PageRank Algorithm

### 5.2.1 Forward Influence Propagation

The forward pass computes structural importance using standard PageRank on the original graph structure. This measures how agents and artifacts contribute to the overall network structure and identifies nodes that serve as important hubs or connectors in the contribution ecosystem.

**Algorithm Specification**:

```
PR_forward(v) = (1-d)/N + d × Σ(u→v) [PR_forward(u) × Weight(u,v) / OutDegree_weighted(u)]
```

Where:

- d is the damping factor (typically 0.85)
- N is the number of nodes in the graph
- Weight(u,v) is the edge weight from node u to node v
- OutDegree_weighted(u) is the sum of weights of outgoing edges from u

**Interpretation**: Forward scores reflect how much influence a node has based on its position in the contribution network. Agents with high forward scores are well-connected contributors who create many artifacts or collaborate with many other contributors. Artifacts with high forward scores are widely used, cited, or built upon by others.

### 5.2.2 Reverse Credit Attribution

The reverse pass propagates credit backward from outcome nodes to identify which agents and artifacts contributed most to valuable outcomes. This involves reversing edges that originate from outcome nodes while maintaining the direction of other edges, then running personalized PageRank with outcome nodes as personalization seeds.

**Graph Transformation**:

- Edges originating from outcome nodes (C → \*) are not reversed, allowing value to flow outward
- All other edges are reversed to enable credit to flow backward through the contribution chain
- Edge weights are preserved but may be modulated by confidence scores and type multipliers

**Personalized PageRank Computation**:

```
PR_reverse(v) = (1-d) × PersonalizationVector(v) + d × Σ(u→v) [PR_reverse(u) × Weight(u,v) / OutDegree_weighted(u)]
```

Where PersonalizationVector(v) = OutcomeValue(v) / TotalOutcomeValue for outcome nodes, 0 for other nodes.

**Interpretation**: Reverse scores reflect how much credit each node deserves based on its contribution to observed valuable outcomes. High reverse scores indicate nodes that are causally connected to realized value, either directly or through chains of contribution.

### 5.2.3 Hybrid Score Combination

The final attribution score combines forward and reverse rankings using a configurable balance parameter α that enables communities to adjust the relative emphasis on structural importance versus outcome-based attribution:

```
HybridScore(agent) = α × PR_forward(agent) + (1-α) × PR_reverse(agent)
```

**Parameter Interpretation**:

- α = 1: Pure structural importance (rewards network centrality regardless of outcomes)
- α = 0: Pure outcome-based attribution (rewards only proximity to demonstrated value)
- α = 0.5: Balanced approach giving equal weight to structure and outcomes

**Community Configuration**: Different domains and communities may prefer different balance points:

- **Research communities** might emphasize outcomes (α ≈ 0.3) to reward impact over productivity
- **Infrastructure projects** might emphasize structure (α ≈ 0.7) to reward foundational work that enables others
- **Commercial projects** might use balanced approaches (α ≈ 0.5) to reward both innovation and execution

### 5.2.4 Convergence and Stability Analysis

**Convergence Guarantees**: The hybrid algorithm inherits convergence properties from standard PageRank. Under standard conditions (strongly connected graph, positive edge weights), both forward and reverse passes converge to unique stationary distributions.

**Sensitivity Analysis**: The system provides tools for analyzing how attribution scores change in response to:

- Parameter variations (α, damping factor, type multipliers)
- Data perturbations (adding or removing nodes/edges)
- Temporal changes (evolution of the graph over time)

**Stability Metrics**: Regular computation of stability metrics helps identify when attribution results are robust versus when they depend heavily on specific parameter choices or data points.

## 5.3 Configurable Evaluation Parameters

### 5.3.1 Community Governance of Algorithms

**Parameter Spaces**: The evaluation system exposes multiple configuration parameters that communities can adjust through governance processes:

- **Balance parameter (α)**: Controls the forward/reverse hybrid combination
- **Edge type multipliers**: Adjust relative importance of different relationship types
- **Node type multipliers**: Weight different entity classes (agents vs. artifacts vs. outcomes)
- **Temporal decay rates**: Control how quickly old contributions lose influence
- **Confidence thresholds**: Set minimum confidence levels for including relationships

**Governance Mechanisms**: Parameter adjustment follows domain-appropriate governance processes:

- **Technical parameters** (convergence criteria, computational limits) governed by system maintainers
- **Evaluation methodology** (α, multipliers) governed by domain expert communities
- **Scope and inclusion criteria** governed by stakeholder representatives

**Impact Simulation**: Before implementing parameter changes, communities can simulate the effects on historical data to understand how modifications would affect attribution patterns and identify potential unintended consequences.

### 5.3.2 Domain-Specific Customization

**Academic Research Configuration**: Research communities might configure the system to:

- Heavily weight citation outcomes over download metrics
- Apply strong temporal decay to emphasize recent work
- Use low α values to emphasize impact over productivity
- Implement peer review confidence scoring

**Open Source Software Configuration**: Developer communities might prefer:

- Strong weighting for dependency relationships

- Integration with code analysis metrics

**Environmental Impact Configuration**: Conservation projects might emphasize:

- Spatial clustering of related projects
- Long temporal windows to capture slow environmental changes
- Integration with satellite monitoring and field verification data
- Stakeholder diversity in evaluation processes

### 5.3.3 Dynamic Parameter Learning

**Adaptive Algorithms**: Future versions of the system could incorporate machine learning approaches to automatically tune parameters based on community feedback and outcome validation:

- **Preference learning**: Infer community preferences from funding allocation decisions and explicit feedback
- **Outcome prediction**: Optimize parameters to maximize correlation with future realized impact
- **Fairness constraints**: Ensure parameter choices don't systematically disadvantage specific contributor groups

**Multi-objective Optimization**: Parameter tuning must balance multiple objectives including accuracy, fairness, gaming resistance, and computational efficiency. Multi-objective optimization frameworks can help communities navigate these trade-offs explicitly.

# 8. Conclusion

## 8.1 Summary of Contributions

This paper presents Hypercerts v.2, a comprehensive framework for scalable impact attribution and retrospective funding that addresses fundamental challenges in coordinating work on public goods. Our system combines three key innovations to enable automated attribution at unprecedented scale while preserving community governance and adaptation capabilities.

**Unified Architecture**: We designed a three-layer system that separates data persistence (Ponder-indexed PostgreSQL with EAS attestations), business logic (ERC4626 vaults and attribution algorithms), and user interfaces. This modularity enables specialized optimization of each component while maintaining system coherence and interoperability.

**Novel Funding Mechanics**: The ERC4626 vault structure creates aligned incentives among contributors, early funders, and grant providers by enabling all stakeholders to benefit from project success through share appreciation. This addresses the temporal misalignment problem that limits retrospective funding systems while preserving the benefits of impact-based reward distribution.

**Hybrid Attribution Algorithm**: Our configurable hybrid PageRank algorithm combines forward influence propagation with reverse credit attribution, enabling communities to balance structural importance against outcome-based evaluation according to their specific value systems. The mathematical framework is rigorous yet flexible enough to adapt to diverse domains and evolving community preferences.

**Practical Implementation**: The system addresses real-world deployment challenges through careful consideration of scalability, security, governance, and regulatory compliance. The gradual adoption pathway and integration capabilities enable existing communities to benefit from hypercerts functionality without requiring complete system replacement.

## 8.2 Impact on Public Goods Funding

Hypercerts v.2 has the potential to transform how societies coordinate and incentivize work on public goods by enabling scalable retrospective funding that addresses key limitations of existing approaches:

**Attribution at Scale**: The automated attribution system can evaluate contributions across millions of contributors and thousands of projects, removing the scalability bottlenecks that limit expert-driven evaluation systems. This enables retrospective funding to operate at the scale of modern digital ecosystems.

**Cross-Project Coordination**: The global attribution network recognizes contributions that span project boundaries, addressing the chronic underinvestment in shared infrastructure and cross-cutting research that benefits multiple projects but is claimed by none.

**Temporal Coordination**: The vault structure bridges the gap between immediate funding needs and eventual impact realization, enabling projects to access capital while ensuring that retrospective rewards flow to all contributors, including early supporters who took risk before outcomes were certain.

**Community Sovereignty**: The configurable evaluation parameters enable different communities to encode their specific value systems into attribution algorithms while benefiting from shared infrastructure and network effects.

## 8.3 Research and Development Implications

**Algorithmic Innovation**: The hybrid PageRank approach opens new research directions in network-based evaluation, including temporal attribution models, machine learning-based parameter optimization, and integration with domain-specific impact measurement frameworks.

**Mechanism Design**: The combination of tokenized vaults with automated attribution creates novel mechanism design challenges around incentive alignment, gaming resistance, and fair value distribution among heterogeneous stakeholder groups.

**Decentralized Governance**: The multi-level governance framework provides a template for managing complex systems where different parameter types require different forms of community input and expertise.

**Impact Measurement**: The standardized attestation framework enables systematic research on impact measurement methodologies, cross-domain comparison of evaluation approaches, and empirical validation of attribution algorithms.

## 8.4 Ecosystem Development Opportunities

**Platform Integration**: The system's API-first design and standardized interfaces create opportunities for integration with existing project management tools, funding platforms, and research infrastructure, enabling gradual adoption without ecosystem disruption.

**Developer Ecosystem**: Third-party developers can build specialized tools for different domains while benefiting from shared attribution infrastructure, creating network effects that increase value for all participants.

**Research Applications**: The comprehensive database of contribution relationships and impact measurements creates unprecedented opportunities for research on innovation systems, collaboration networks, and the dynamics of public goods production.

**Policy Implications**: Governments and foundations could use hypercerts data to guide funding strategies, evaluate program effectiveness, and design policies that better support public goods creation and maintenance.

## 8.5 Limitations and Future Work

**Measurement Challenges**: The system's effectiveness depends on the quality and comprehensiveness of attestation data. Not all valuable contributions can be easily measured or verified, and systematic measurement gaps could lead to biased attribution results.

**Gaming Evolution**: As the system gains adoption and economic importance, gaming strategies will evolve. Continuous research and development of detection and prevention mechanisms will be necessary to maintain system integrity.

**Privacy-Transparency Trade-offs**: The balance between transparency (necessary for accountability and gaming prevention) and privacy (necessary for sensitive research and competitive applications) requires ongoing calibration as community needs and technological capabilities evolve.

**Regulatory Adaptation**: The regulatory landscape for decentralized systems and tokenized assets continues evolving. Long-term success will require ongoing adaptation to changing legal requirements across multiple jurisdictions.

**Scalability Validation**: While the system's architecture is designed for scale, empirical validation at the scale of millions of contributors and thousands of projects will require careful monitoring and potential algorithmic or infrastructure adaptations.

## 8.6 Call for Adoption and Collaboration

Hypercerts v.2 represents a foundational infrastructure for impact funding that becomes more valuable as more communities adopt and contribute to its development. We invite collaboration from:

## 8.7 Vision for Impact Funding

The ultimate vision for Hypercerts v.2 is to create a world where individuals and organizations can confidently invest time, resources, and capital in creating public goods, knowing that if their work proves valuable, they will be fairly recognized and rewarded. This requires not just better technology, but also cultural and institutional changes toward retrospective evaluation and cross-organizational collaboration.

By providing the infrastructure for scalable, fair, and transparent impact attribution, Hypercerts v.2 could enable a transition from funding promises to funding results, from organizational silos to ecosystem-wide collaboration, and from expert gatekeepers to community-governed evaluation. The result could be dramatically increased investment in the public goods that create the foundation for human flourishing and technological progress.

The framework presented here provides a concrete path toward this vision, combining theoretical rigor with practical implementation considerations. Success will require continued collaboration among technologists, researchers, funders, and communities to refine, deploy, and govern these systems in service of our shared goals for a more coordinated and effective approach to creating public value.

The opportunity before us is substantial: to fundamentally improve how human societies coordinate and incentivize work on the shared challenges and opportunities that define our collective future. Hypercerts v.2 provides the tools; realizing the vision requires commitment from all of us who believe that better coordination is possible and necessary.
