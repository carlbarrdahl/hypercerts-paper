# Hypercerts v.2: A Comprehensive Framework for Impact Attribution and Funding

## Paper Outline

### Abstract
- Problem: Current public goods funding lacks scalable impact attribution
- Solution: Hypercerts v.2 with ERC4626 vaults, EAS attestations, and hybrid PageRank evaluation
- Key contributions: Unified architecture for impact tracking, attribution, and retrospective funding

### 1. Introduction
