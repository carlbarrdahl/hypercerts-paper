# Abstract

Public goods funding faces a fundamental attribution problem: how to fairly reward contributors for impact that is non-excludable, non-rivalrous, and often emerges through complex collaboration networks. Existing mechanisms—from grants to retroactive funding programs—struggle to scale attribution across large ecosystems while maintaining transparency and preventing gaming.

We present Hypercerts v.2, a comprehensive framework that combines tokenized project vaults, decentralized attestation systems, and automated impact evaluation to enable scalable retrospective funding. Our architecture integrates three key innovations: (1) ERC4626 vaults that align early funders with long-term project success through shared upside mechanisms, (2) a hybrid on-chain/off-chain attestation system using the Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) with PostgreSQL draft storage for graduated transparency, and (3) a configurable hybrid PageRank algorithm that attributes impact across networks of agents, artifacts, and outcomes.

The system models contributions as a directed weighted graph where agents (contributors) create artifacts (code, papers, designs) that generate outcomes (funding, citations, usage). Our hybrid attribution algorithm combines forward influence propagation with reverse credit flow, balanced by community-configurable parameters that encode domain-specific value systems. This enables automated reward distribution while preserving human judgment in weight setting and evaluation quality.

We demonstrate the framework's applicability across diverse domains including scientific research, environmental projects, open-source software, and creative industries. The architecture supports both public transparency through on-chain attestations and privacy through confidential PostgreSQL storage, with semantic similarity detection to prevent duplicate claims and gaming.

Hypercerts v.2 provides a scalable, interoperable foundation for impact funding that could transform how we coordinate and incentivize work on public and common goods. By automating attribution while preserving community governance, the system enables retrospective funding at unprecedented scale while maintaining the flexibility to adapt to domain-specific needs and evolving value systems.
