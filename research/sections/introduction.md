# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 The Public Goods Funding Problem

Public goods—from scientific research and open-source software to environmental conservation and artistic works—suffer from chronic underfunding due to their non-excludable and non-rivalrous nature. Contributors cannot easily capture the value they create, leading to market failures where socially beneficial work remains under-incentivized. Traditional funding mechanisms attempt to address this through grants, donations, and philanthropic support, but these approaches face fundamental limitations.

**Attribution Complexity**: Most impactful work emerges from complex networks of collaboration, building on prior contributions, and involving both visible and hidden contributors. A breakthrough scientific paper may depend on dozens of prior works, infrastructure maintained by volunteers, and peer reviewers who remain anonymous. Current funding systems struggle to fairly attribute and reward all participants in these contribution networks.

**Scaling Challenges**: Expert-driven evaluation, while high-quality, cannot scale to evaluate the thousands of projects and millions of contributors in modern digital ecosystems. Manual review processes create bottlenecks and introduce subjective biases that may systematically under-reward certain types of contributions or contributors.

**Temporal Misalignment**: The value of public goods often becomes apparent only after significant time delays. A mathematical proof may take decades to find practical applications; an environmental conservation project may show benefits only over generational timescales. Traditional funding requires predictions about future impact, but these predictions are notoriously unreliable.

**Gaming and Verification**: Any funding system creates incentives for strategic behavior. Contributors may inflate their contributions, duplicate claims across platforms, or engage in collusive evaluation. Verifying the authenticity and uniqueness of impact claims becomes increasingly difficult as systems scale.

## 1.2 Vision: Hypercerts v.2

Hypercerts v.2 addresses these challenges through a comprehensive framework that separates funding, attestation, evaluation, and reward distribution into modular, interoperable components. The system builds on the foundational concept of hypercerts—semi-fungible tokens that encode claims about work and impact—while introducing novel mechanisms for automated attribution and retrospective reward distribution.

**Key Innovations**:

1. **Tokenized Project Vaults**: ERC4626-compliant vaults represent projects as tokenized entities where shares can be minted to different stakeholder classes (contributors, early funders, stewards). This creates aligned incentives where early risk-taking is rewarded through upside participation in future funding rounds.

2. **Hybrid Attestation System**: Combines the transparency of on-chain Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS) records with the privacy and flexibility of off-chain PostgreSQL storage. Contributors can create private draft attestations, collaborate on verification, and selectively publish to the public chain.

3. **Automated Impact Attribution**: A configurable hybrid PageRank algorithm analyzes networks of contributions to automatically distribute attribution scores. The algorithm combines forward influence propagation (rewarding structural importance) with reverse credit flow (emphasizing proximity to valued outcomes).

4. **Multi-chain Integration**: Ponder-based indexing aggregates data across multiple blockchains while creating semantic embeddings for duplicate detection and spatial queries for location-based impact verification.

**Alignment with Retrospective Funding**: Unlike traditional grants that fund promises, Hypercerts v.2 emphasizes retrospective funding—rewarding work after its impact has been demonstrated. However, the tokenized vault structure ensures that early supporters can still participate in upside, addressing the capital formation challenges that pure retrospective systems face.

## 1.3 Theoretical Foundation

The system implements the Generalized Impact Evaluators (GIE) framework, which formalizes impact funding as a tuple IE = {r, e, m, S} where:
- **Scope (S)** defines the entities and relationships under consideration
- **Measurement (m)** collects data about contributions and outcomes
- **Evaluation (e)** computes relative importance scores
- **Reward (r)** distributes resources proportionally

By making these components explicit and modular, Hypercerts v.2 enables different stakeholders to specialize: data providers focus on measurement quality, algorithm designers optimize evaluation methods, and funding organizations manage reward distribution. This separation of concerns allows the system to evolve and adapt while maintaining interoperability.

## 1.4 Paper Contributions

This paper makes several key contributions:

**Technical Architecture**: We present the complete technical specification for Hypercerts v.2, including smart contract interfaces, data schemas, and integration protocols. This provides a concrete implementation path for the theoretical GIE framework.

**Hybrid Attribution Algorithm**: We develop a novel hybrid PageRank algorithm that combines structural network analysis with outcome-based attribution, enabling communities to configure evaluation parameters to reflect their specific value systems.

**Privacy-Preserving Attestation**: We design a graduated transparency system where sensitive work claims can be developed privately before selective public disclosure, addressing real-world needs for confidentiality in competitive research and commercial applications.

**Empirical Applications**: We analyze concrete use cases across scientific research, environmental projects, open-source software, and creative industries, demonstrating the framework's broad applicability while identifying domain-specific adaptation requirements.

**Implementation Framework**: We provide detailed implementation considerations including gaming resistance mechanisms, privacy trade-offs, governance structures, and adoption strategies necessary for real-world deployment.

The result is a comprehensive system that could transform how we fund and coordinate work on public goods, enabling retrospective funding at unprecedented scale while preserving the human judgment and community governance necessary for legitimacy and adaptation.
