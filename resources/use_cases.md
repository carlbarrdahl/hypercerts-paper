# Use‑Cases and Potential

Hypercerts serve as a primitive for numerous use‑cases:

- Scientific research – Fund open research or reproducible experiments, attach papers and data sets and allow peer review as attestations.

- Environmental projects – Fund tree planting, carbon sequestration or biodiversity initiatives, record work claims and field verification data.

- Public goods and HyperSponsor – Support open‑source software or art, where early backers share in upside when the project receives grants or donation matching. Hypercerts could integrate with quadratic funding rounds.

- Retroactive funding – Allow communities or protocols to retroactively fund projects by donating to vaults, increasing the value of earlier impact tokens.

- Reputation systems – Use EAS attestations and trust graphs to build decentralized reputation across projects and evaluators.
